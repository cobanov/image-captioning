# Image Captioning

Captioning is an img2txt model that uses the BLIP. Exports captions of images.

## Checkpoints [Required]

If there is no 'Checkpoints' folder, the script will automatically create the folder and download the model file, you can do this manually if you want.

Download the fine-tuned checkpoint and copy into 'checkpoints' folder (create if does not exists)

Image caption CLI

optional arguments:
  -h, --help                      show this help message and exit
  -i INPUT,  --input INPUT        Input directoryt path, such as ./images
  -b BATCH,  --batch BATCH        Batch size
